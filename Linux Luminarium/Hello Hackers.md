## Intro to Commands
This challenge was direct and required a simple 'hello' commands to generate the flag.
## Intro to Arguments
### Arguments
Arguments are the subsequent words entered after the command
`echo Hello`
Command: _echo_
Argument: _Hello_

The next challenge required us to enter the command _hello_ with the argument _hackers_.
```hacker@hello~intro-to-arguments:~$ hello hackers
Success! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{Mozdd6BwuHMb7zDTw8jowkzmJAc.dhjNyUDLyUDN1czW}
hacker@hello~intro-to-arguments:~$ ```
