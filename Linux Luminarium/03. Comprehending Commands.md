# Linux Commands
## Cat: not the pet, but the command!
* *cat* is used to read out files
* cat will concatenate (hence the name) multiple files if provided multiple arguments. For example:
```
hacker@dojo:~$ cat myfile
This is my file!
hacker@dojo:~$ cat yourfile
This is your file!
hacker@dojo:~$ cat myfile yourfile
This is my file!
This is your file!
hacker@dojo:~$ cat myfile yourfile myfile
This is my file!
This is your file!
This is my file!
```
This was a simple challenge to use the `cat` command.
```
hacker@commands~cat-not-the-pet-but-the-command:~$ cat flag
pwn.college{cmriCaswL5y7K1X77uYiZ_Y3gmx.dFzN1QDLyUDN1czW}
```

## catting absolute paths

cat can be used with absolute paths as arguments.

```
hacker@commands~catting-absolute-paths:~$ cat /flag
pwn.college{4fimd9uDgmPNFV-Al0lXIS-w4_B.dlTM5QDLyUDN1czW}

```

## more catting practice

In this challenge, `cd` was disabled and we were given the absolute path of the flag to use with `cat` command.

```
hacker@commands~more-catting-practice:~$ cat /lib/bfd-plugins/flag
pwn.college{4VG-tXhFkiUImIPbccZEp-pNxYj.dBjM5QDLyUDN1czW}
```
