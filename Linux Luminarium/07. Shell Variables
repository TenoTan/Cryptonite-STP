# Shell Variables
This module focuses on understanding and using shell variables in Linux. Shell variables are used to store data that can be referenced and manipulated throughout a shell session, enhancing scripting and command-line efficiency.

## Defining Variables
- Variables can be defined without spaces around the `=` sign.
- Example: Define a variable `name`:
  ```bash
  name="John"
  ```
## Accessing Variables
- Use the $ sign to access the value of a variable.
- Example: Print the value of name:
```bash
    echo $name
```
## Using Special Variables
- Special variables provide important information about the shell environment.
- Example: Use $? to get the exit status of the last command:
```bash
    echo $?
```
## Variable Scope
- Local variables are accessible only within the function or script they are defined in.

## Exporting Variables
- Use export to make a variable available to child processes.
- Example: Export the name variable:
``` bash
    export name
```
## Unsetting Variables
- Use unset to remove a variable from the shell environment.
- Example: Unset the name variable:
```bash 
unset name
```

## Using Command Substitution
- Use command substitution to assign the output of a command to a variable.
- Example: Assign the current date to a variable:
``` bash 
    current_date=$(date)
```
## Using Command Substitution
- Use command substitution to assign the output of a command to a variable.
- Example: Assign the current date to a variable:
``` bash 
    current_date=$(date)
```
