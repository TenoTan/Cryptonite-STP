# Linux Luminarium: Pondering Paths

## Path Variable 
- The PATH variable is a colon-separated list of directories.
- You can view the current PATH using the `echo $PATH` command.
- Adding or modifying directories in PATH allows the shell to recognize commands stored in those directories.

**Command Example:**  
```bash
echo $PATH
```

## Setting Path
In this challenge, the focus is on manually setting the PATH variable. Understanding how to manipulate PATH is important for customizing the execution environment or limiting the scope of executable locations.

- PATH can be modified temporarily by assigning new values:  
  ```bash
  export PATH=/custom/directory:$PATH
  ```
- Itâ€™s important to prepend or append the new path to the existing PATH to avoid losing access to essential system binaries.

- Misconfiguring PATH (e.g., excluding `/bin` or `/usr/bin`) can prevent basic commands from being found.

## Adding Commands 
This challenge covers adding custom commands or scripts to directories included in PATH. By doing so, we can create new commands that are recognized globally without specifying full paths.

- Any executable placed in a directory that is part of PATH can be invoked directly.
- You can write simple scripts and place them in directories like `/usr/local/bin` or `$HOME/bin` to make them accessible from anywhere in the terminal.

```bash
echo 'echo Hello, World!' > /usr/local/bin/hello
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/hello
```
- Running `hello` now prints "Hello, World!" from any location.

### 4. Hijacking Commands
The final challenge explores command hijacking by modifying PATH or placing malicious scripts in a PATH directory with names that mimic trusted commands. This illustrates the potential security risks when PATH is misconfigured.
  
- If a directory containing a malicious script is added earlier in the PATH than standard system directories, that script will be executed instead of the legitimate command.
- This can lead to privilege escalation or running unwanted code.

- To prevent hijacking, ensure that untrusted directories are not placed at the beginning of the PATH.
- Always use full paths (e.g., `/bin/ls`) for critical commands in scripts or cron jobs.
