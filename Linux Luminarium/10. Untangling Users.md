# Untangling Users

## User Accounts:
- Linux identifies users by both a **username** and a **User ID (UID)**.
- User information is stored in the `/etc/passwd` file, which contains a list of all users along with details such as their home directory and shell.

## Groups:
- Groups in Linux are a way of organizing users to manage permissions efficiently.
- Each user is assigned to a primary group, and they can be a member of additional supplementary groups. Group information is stored in the `/etc/group` file.
- Commands like `usermod` allow users to be added or removed from groups.

## Managing Users:
- The **`useradd`** command is used to create new users. It automatically creates a home directory for the user in `/home/<username>`, and you can set default shell, expiration date, and more.
  
  Example:
  ```bash
  sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash <username>
  ```
-The usermod command modifies existing users, such as changing their home directory, shell, or group memberships.
``` bash
    sudo usermod -d /new/home/dir <username>
```
- The userdel command is used to delete users and, optionally, their home directories.

Example:
``` bash
    sudo userdel -r <username>
```
## Password Management:
**User passwords are managed in the /etc/shadow file, which contains encrypted password data.**

- The passwd command allows users to change their own passwords and administrators to reset passwords for other users.
Example:
``` bash
    sudo passwd <username>
```
## Sudo Privileges:
**Users can be granted administrative privileges through the sudo system, allowing them to execute commands as root. This is configured via the /etc/sudoers file or by adding users to the sudo group.**
