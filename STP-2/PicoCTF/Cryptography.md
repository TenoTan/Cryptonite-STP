## spelling-quiz
flag: `picoCTF{perhaps_the_dog_jumped_over_was_just_tired}`

### Approach
* The python file gave hints that substitution cipher has been used to encrypt the code.
* Since the decoder could not exactly figure out the flag, had to use the frequency analysis to make a guess.
* The most common word in english being e and the most repeated letter in the encrypted flag being r, i used this substitution.

### Incorrect Attempts
* Could not figure out much with the study guide. Found another way to do it before I could use it further.
