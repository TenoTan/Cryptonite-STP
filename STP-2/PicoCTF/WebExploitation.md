## Where are the robots
flag: `picoCTF{ca1cu1at1ng_Mach1n3s_477ce}`
### Approach
* added `/robots.txt` to the url
  `https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/36474/robots.txt`
* this showed me the disallowed extension
```
User-agent: *
Disallow: /477ce.html
```
* chedked into the url `https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/36474/477ce.html`
* found the flag

### Learning
* searched up about the robots.txt file. The content in the file instructs automated web bots on how to crawl and/or index a website. Often, sensitive information is also mentioned in this file.
* In web exploitation, the **user-agent** identifies client details like device, OS, and browser, which attackers can manipulate to evade detection, bypass security filters, and blend in with normal traffic. By spoofing user-agents, attackers can also gather reconnaissance data to target vulnerable systems, making it a valuable tool in web attacks.

### Incorrect Attempts
* Spent a lot of time trying to find the flag in the html or other attached elements.
* On inpecting the css file, figured that the 'flag' element is written in red. That got me nowhere considering i was still on the homepage.
