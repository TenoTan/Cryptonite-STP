# Perceiving Permissions
## Understanding File Permissions

In Linux, every file or directory has three sets of permissions, each associated with different categories of users:
- **Owner**: The user who owns the file.
- **Group**: Users belonging to the group associated with the file.
- **Others**: All other users not in the owner or group categories.

Each set consists of three types of permissions:
- **Read (r)**: Allows viewing the fileâ€™s contents.
- **Write (w)**: Allows modifying or deleting the file.
- **Execute (x)**: Allows running the file if it's a script or program, or entering a directory.

These permissions are represented in a 10-character string when using the `ls -l` command. For example:
This string breaks down as:
- `-` indicates it's a regular file (directories use `d`).
- `rwx` for the owner: read, write, execute.
- `r-x` for the group: read and execute, but no write.
- `r--` for others: only read permission.

## Changing Permissions with `chmod`

The `chmod` command is used to change file permissions. You can use either symbolic or numeric notation:
- **Symbolic**: For example, `chmod u+x filename` adds execute permission for the user (owner).
- **Numeric**: Each permission has a numeric value: 
  - Read = 4
  - Write = 2
  - Execute = 1
  These values are summed for each category. For instance, `chmod 755 filename` sets:
  - Owner: `rwx` (7 = 4+2+1)
  - Group: `r-x` (5 = 4+1)
  - Others: `r-x` (5 = 4+1)

## Changing Ownership with `chown` and `chgrp`

The `chown` command changes the ownership of a file: chown new_owner filename
To change the group, use: chgrp new_group filename
chown new_owner
filename

## Special Permissions: SUID, SGID, and Sticky Bit

In addition to the standard read, write, and execute permissions, Linux has three special permission bits:
- **SUID (Set User ID)**: If set on an executable file, the process will run with the file owner's permissions, not the user's.
- **SGID (Set Group ID)**: If set on a directory, new files created in that directory inherit the group of the directory.
- **Sticky Bit**: Typically used on directories, it ensures that only the file's owner can delete or rename files within the directory, even if others have write access.

## Viewing and Modifying Permissions

To view the permissions of a file or directory, use: ls -l filename
To change permissions, use `chmod`, and for ownership use `chown` or `chgrp` as discussed.

## Real-world Applications

Understanding file permissions is essential for securing a Linux system. Incorrect permissions can lead to unauthorized access, data modification, or execution of malicious files. By carefully managing permissions and using tools like `chmod`, `chown`, and special permissions, system administrators can enforce proper security controls.
