# File Globbing

## matching with * 
`*` can be replaced with characters of a file we don't know.

```
This challenge resets your working directory to /home/hacker unless you change 
directory properly...
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:~$ cd /c*
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:/challenge$ /challenge/run
You ran me with the working directory of /challenge! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{oY_EdMVi7vHcUeMPndMxJUbU08o.dFjM4QDLyUDN1czW}
```

## matching with ?

`?` differes from `*` only in th esense of checking with only one character.

pwn.college{ESjSgqXYExKhQdaauzM1XMSWmdQ.dJjM4QDLyUDN1czW}
```

## matching wiht []
We give a range of possible characters in bewteene the bracets to find only amog the given characters
```
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:/challenge/files$ /challenge/run file_[absh]
You got it! Here is your flag!
pwn.college{0_prp2bODvCuMnoXmBrTmcM2T3r.dNjM4QDLyUDN1czW}
```

## matching paths with []
we can use the [] with absolute paths.
```
hacker@globbing~matching-paths-with-:~$ /challenge/run /challenge/files/file_[bash]
You got it! Here is your flag!
pwn.college{4E02-Cf89eok7CxLxfx3-9INtPQ.dRjM4QDLyUDN1czW}

## Exclusoonary Globbing
If the first character in the brackets is a `!` or (in newer versions of bash) a `^`, the glob inverts, and that bracket instance matches characters that aren't listed.

* The `!` character has a different special meaning in bash when it's not the first character of a `[]` glob, so keep that in mind if things stop making sense! `^` does not have this problem, but is also not compatible with older shells.
