# Processes and Jobs
This module focuses on managing processes and jobs in Linux. Understanding processes—how to view, control, and manipulate them—is key to mastering Linux environments, as every command and application runs as a process. This module introduces key concepts like foreground and background jobs, signals, and process control mechanisms.

## Viewing Running Processes
- Every running command in Linux is a process.
- The `ps` command is used to view active processes and their details.
  - `ps aux` provides a detailed list of all running processes with columns like PID, TTY, TIME, and CMD.
  - `ps -e` shows all processes running on the system.
  ```bash
   ps aux
   ps -e
  ```
- Each process has a unique Process ID (PID), which is used to control and manage the process.

## Sending Signals to Processes
- Signals are used to control processes, with common signals including SIGTERM (terminate) and SIGKILL (force kill).

- The kill command is used to send signals to processes.

- kill [PID] sends the SIGTERM signal by default, politely requesting a process to terminate.
- kill -9 [PID] sends SIGKILL, forcefully terminating the process.
``` bash
    kill 1234  # sends SIGTERM
    kill -9 1234  # sends SIGKILL
```
- To list all available signals, use:
``` bash
    kill -l
```
## Foreground and Background Processes
- Commands run in the foreground by default, blocking the terminal until the process finishes.

- Append & to a command to run it in the background, allowing the terminal to remain interactive:
``` bash
    sleep 60 &
```
- Use jobs to list background jobs and fg to bring a job to the foreground.
``` bash 
    jobs
    fg %1
```
## Suspending and Resuming Processes
- Processes can be paused (suspended) and resumed as needed.
- Use Ctrl + Z to suspend a running process.
- Resume a suspended process in the foreground with fg or in the background with bg.
``` bash
    fg %1  # brings job 1 to the foreground
    bg %1  # resumes job 1 in the background
```
## Monitoring System Resource Usage with top
- The top command provides real-time information about system resource usage, including CPU and memory consumption.

- top shows a dynamic list of processes, sorted by resource usage.
- Within top, you can press k to kill a process by its PID, and q to quit.
``` bash
    top
```
- Use htop for an interactive, more user-friendly process viewer (if installed).

## Process Priorities with nice and renice
- Processes can have different priorities, influencing how the system allocates CPU time.

- The nice command starts a process with a specified priority:

- nice -n 10 command lowers the priority, whereas negative values increase priority (requires superuser privileges).
``` bash
    nice -n 10 sleep 100
```
- Use renice to change the priority of an already running process:

```bash
    renice 10 -p 1234  # changes priority of process with PID 1234
```
## Killing Background Jobs with kill and pkill
- The kill command can be used to terminate background jobs by their job number or PID.
``` bash
    kill %1  # kills job 1
    kill 1234  # kills process with PID 1234
```
- The pkill command allows you to kill processes by name:
``` bash 
    pkill sleep  # kills all processes named "sleep"
```
## Tracking Process Trees with pstree
- The pstree command displays running processes in a hierarchical, tree-like structure.

- This helps visualize parent-child relationships between processes.
``` bash
    pstree
```
- Use pstree -p to display PIDs along with the process tree.

## Daemon Processes
- Daemon processes run in the background and are not tied to a terminal session.

- They typically start during boot and continue running without user interaction, such as sshd for managing SSH connections.

- Daemon processes can be viewed using:
``` bash 
    ps aux | grep daemon_name
```
