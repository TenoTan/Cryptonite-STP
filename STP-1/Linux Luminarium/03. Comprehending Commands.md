# Linux Commands
## Cat: not the pet, but the command!
* *cat* is used to read out files
* cat will concatenate (hence the name) multiple files if provided multiple arguments. For example:
```
hacker@dojo:~$ cat myfile
This is my file!
hacker@dojo:~$ cat yourfile
This is your file!
hacker@dojo:~$ cat myfile yourfile
This is my file!
This is your file!
hacker@dojo:~$ cat myfile yourfile myfile
This is my file!
This is your file!
This is my file!
```
This was a simple challenge to use the `cat` command.
```
hacker@commands~cat-not-the-pet-but-the-command:~$ cat flag
pwn.college{cmriCaswL5y7K1X77uYiZ_Y3gmx.dFzN1QDLyUDN1czW}
```

## catting absolute paths

cat can be used with absolute paths as arguments.

```
hacker@commands~catting-absolute-paths:~$ cat /flag
pwn.college{4fimd9uDgmPNFV-Al0lXIS-w4_B.dlTM5QDLyUDN1czW}

```

## more catting practice

In this challenge, `cd` was disabled and we were given the absolute path of the flag to use with `cat` command.

```
hacker@commands~more-catting-practice:~$ cat /lib/bfd-plugins/flag
pwn.college{4VG-tXhFkiUImIPbccZEp-pNxYj.dBjM5QDLyUDN1czW}
```

## grepping for a needle in haystack
`grep` is a command used to search for text in a text file.

## listing files
`ls` command is used to list files in the current directory.

## touching files
`touch` command is used to create new files.

```
hacker@commands~touching-files:~$ touch /tmp/pwn
hacker@commands~touching-files:~$ touch /tmp/college
hacker@commands~touching-files:~$ /challenge/run
Success! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{sr6y8bvemCFC5U8RiJLuBl0nCSj.dBzM4QDLyUDN1czW}
```

## removing files
`rm file-name` deletes the file.

```
hacker@commands~removing-files:~$ ls
 Desktop   delete_me   file  '~'
hacker@commands~removing-files:~$ rm delete_me
hacker@commands~removing-files:~$ ls
 Desktop   file  '~'
hacker@commands~removing-files:~$ /challenge/check
Excellent removal. Here is your reward:
pwn.college{Io4bRk6rdcNAMv84b5OCvXmX7Kt.dZTOwUDLyUDN1czW}
```
## hidden files
`ls -a` is used to list out hidden files. ALl of them start with a period `.`.

```
hacker@commands~hidden-files:~$ cd /
hacker@commands~hidden-files:/$ ls -a
.                     bin        etc    lib64   nix   run   tmp
..                    boot       home   libx32  opt   sbin  usr
.dockerenv            challenge  lib    media   proc  srv   var
.flag-24236956828160  dev        lib32  mnt     root  sys
hacker@commands~hidden-files:/$ cat .flag-24236956828160
pwn.college{ItuLKyM_EnugwSN_85-XTgwFxqb.dBTN4QDLyUDN1czW}
```

## An Epic Filesystem Quest
After a series of quests to find the flag in numerous directories based on the clues given, flag was found in the final directory.
In the cases where the clues said cd'ing into the given directory directly will self-destruct the next clue, I used `ls` command and `cat` command with the whole path as an argument to the function to read acces the next clues.

## making directories
`mkdir` command is used to make directories.

## finding files
The `find` command takes optional arguments describing the search criteria and the search location. If you don't specify a search criteria, find matches every file. If you don't specify a search location, find uses the current working directory `.`.
